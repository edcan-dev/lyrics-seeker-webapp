Lyrics Seeker WebAPP, This uses HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

This is a little app I created for learning purpouses, it uses HTML, CSS and JS. I developed this one becasue I think that I need to feel totally comfort using Vanilla JS, it means, without any library like JQuery or React.

The API that I used was Lyrics.ovh, you can read how it work here:

I feel insterested in create more projects and start learning React to improve this App with that library.
